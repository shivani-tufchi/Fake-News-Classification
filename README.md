# Fake-News-Classification
OSMs, or online social media networks, have become significant information sources. The speed with which OSM users provide data makes it difficult to moderate. As a result, OSMs are increasingly used to spread misleading information in addition to giving users options for online networking. People distribute inaccurate information on OSMs, whether on purpose or not, which has an adverse effect on someone's offline operations. A number of specialised websites (sometimes known as fact-checkers) have emerged in response to fake news, with the main objective of spotting and reporting fake news instances..
There are well-known datasets of fake news, but there hasn't been much work done in India on reputable databases of fake news.With the best of our knowledge and belief there is no such dataset consisting of fake as well real articles for classification task.Therefore, we have designed a dataset which  includes fake/real news reported by fact-checkers  from the authentic sources in India. We 
 have gathered and combined articles for the fake news and real news incidents from  few Indian datasets.We found that the data is quit imbalanced with more real news stories than fake.Excessive cleaning and preprocessing  of the data has been done which includes(removing unncessary words,tokenizing,lemmatizing,POS Tagging).Finally  word embeddings has been generated using keras layers on Word2VEC for classifying the data as real or fake.
